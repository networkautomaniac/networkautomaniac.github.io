        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Aaron Britton, a Network Automation Engineer at Network to Code. With over a decade of
          experience as a Senior Network Engineer in the Aerospace industry, my journey into network automation began at
          Cisco Live in 2018. Since then, I've been focused on learning and implementing automation solutions for network
          infrastructure.  During my time in the Aerospace industry, I gained extensive experience in designing
          and managing complex network environments and it was at Cisco Live where the potential of network automation
          piqued my interest, leading me to shift my focus towards automation.</p>
        <p>I'm relatively new to HTML and CSS so this site was created using Jekyll along with Bootstrap5 as an
          opportunity for me to learn and practice these technologies while creating a platform to share my experiences
          and insights through a blog. I'm excited to explore the possibilities and improve my skills in web
          development.</p>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>I work with network automation and orchestration, using various tools and technologies to
          develop automation solutions.</p>
        <ul class="text-start">
          <li><strong>Python:</strong> I create custom automation scripts and applications to streamline network
            operations, utilizing libraries and frameworks such as Netmiko, NAPALM, Flask and Django.</li>
          <li><strong>Ansible:</strong> I use Ansible for configuration management, network provisioning and writing
            playbooks that ensure consistent and error-free deployments across network devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Containerization allows me to package and deploy automation tools and services
            efficiently. I also use Docker to simulate network environments for testing and development purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Containerlab:</strong> I leverage Containerlab to build and manage container-based network labs,
            facilitating the development and testing of network automation solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Learning and Growth</h3>
        <p>I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and
          technologies in network automation. I regularly participate in training classes, reading books, blogs, attending
          conferences and contributing to open-source projects to enhance my skills.</p>
